# Buck$imple

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an immense crash in the economy. Unemployment rates have drastically spiked causing despair, anxiety and stress amongst families. Bills are being left unpaid, food can not be served at the table, people are getting evicted from their homes etc. All of this is happening because of the lack on one simple thing- MONEY. So, what can be done about this issue?

Buck$imple is a full-stack MERN web application developed to tackle this very problem. I decided to create this platform to encourage individuals to unite and help each other out. Employers can create job postings for very straighforward tasks like mowing the lawn and washing dishes to provide oppourtunities for struggling individuals to make money. I believe Buck$imple will play a crucial role in the economic recovery of society and provide people a chance and courage to fight against the terrors COVID-19 has caused.

Buck$imple features a database created in MongoDB which contains user information and postings information. Node and Express were used to develop the server and create a REST API to send HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend. Finally, I built a visually-appealing frontend with React, hooks and styled components. User Sign In and Sign Up has been implemented to identify users on the website and also to gain the ability to post as it is impossible to create a post without making an account. JWT and hashed passwords have also been included to prevent unauthorized access and boost security.
